🧠 NeuroBridge – An AI-Powered Cognitive Learning Companion
Team UDAAN | B.M.S College of Engineering
Project Theme: Education + Healthcare

🚀 Overview
NeuroBridge is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform built to empower neurodivergent students (those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc.) by offering personalized, multi-modal educational experiences. By combining education technology with healthcare insights, NeuroBridge creates an inclusive digital classroom where every learner thrives.

🧩 Problem Statement
Millions of students with cognitive challenges struggle in traditional learning environments due to:

Overwhelming content

Lack of adaptive support

One-size-fits-all teaching styles

Minimal emotional or engagement feedback

✅ Our Solution
NeuroBridge uses AI and emotion-aware systems to deliver tailored content that adapts in real-time to student needs:

🎯 Real-Time Neuro-Adaptive Learning
Gaze tracking & emotion analysis adjust content pace/style dynamically.

🎧 Simplified, Multi-Modal Lessons
AI-generated audio, visuals, and gamified quizzes enhance engagement.

📊 Insightful Dashboards
Parents and teachers can track focus, progress, and cognitive metrics weekly.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Technology Used
Frontend (App)	Flutter (Mobile), React (Web)
Backend	Firebase (Auth, DB, Storage)
AI Models	GPT-4 (NLP), DALL·E (Visuals)
TTS Integration	Text-to-Speech APIs
Emotion Tracking	MediaPipe, Voice Tone Analysis
Data Visualization	Chart.js or similar

🔁 Workflow & Architecture
Input Acquisition: Uploads textbook/PDFs, extracts clean text

Content Simplification: GPT-4 rephrases into digestible formats

Multi-Modal Generation: Converts content to audio, images, quizzes

Simulated Cognitive Load Detection: Webcam & mic detect attention/emotion

Adaptive Learning Engine: Adjusts pace & style in real time

Feedback Loop: Micro-assessments to boost engagement

Real-Time Dashboards: Tracks learner metrics for educators/parents


📈 Feasibility & Market Potential
🔧 Technical Feasibility
Uses widely available tech (Firebase, GPT-4o, React, Flutter)

MVP is achievable using mock data within 24 hours

No costly EEG hardware required (simulated tracking instead)

📊 Market Demand
15–20% of school-aged children are neurodivergent

Global EdTech market = $400+ billion by 2030

Rising need for adaptive, inclusive educational tools

🧠 Competitive Edge
Combines education + healthcare in one platform

Emotion-aware real-time adaptivity

Serves an underserved niche with scalable architecture
